# This script contains the function ComputeSignificanceThreshold()
# It will compute the adjusted significance threshold

ComputeSignificanceThreshold = function(input.file) {
# The function computes the significance threshold for your data
# 
# Args: 
#   input.file: Your input file name
#
# Returns:
#   The number of independent tests, Bonferroni correction, and significance threshold

# =================================================
# Load input file
# =================================================
    input = fread(input.file)

# =================================================
# Clean data frame
# =================================================
# Make copy of data frame because later the data frame will be rearranged by chromosome number and base position
    copy.input = copy(input)

# Sort the data frame based on chromosome number and base position, rather than sorting the data by p-values
# Because effectiveSize() adjusts for autocorrelation between p-values, so if the function is computed on a sorted p-value, you will get a really small number
    setorder(copy.input, chr, Probe)

# =================================================
# Calculate the significance threshold
# =================================================
# coda: calculates adjusted significance threshold with Bonferroni correction
# effectiveSize() adjusts for autocorrelation (correlation between values)
# effectiveSize() basically calculates the number of independent tests
#   Need to add -log10 when calculating effectiveSize since the function requires large numbers not small numbers(ex:10^-6 will be converted to 6) 
    total_eff = effectiveSize(-log10(copy.input$p))
# Output is :
    # var 1
    # Number
# Since we only need the number for the threshold, as.numeric() will fix this and return just a numeric value, and this numeric value is carried throughout the rest of the code
    total_eff = as.numeric(total_eff)

# Bonferroni correction: divide alpha level(0.05) by the number of independent test
# <<- makes p.adj variable global, so that it can be called in other scripts
    p.adj <<- 0.05/total_eff

# After -log10 transformation
    transformation = -log10(p.adj)

# List out number of independent tests, the adjusted threshold, and the threshold after -log10 transformation
    return(list("Number of Independent Tests" = total_eff, "Bonferroni correction" = p.adj, "Significance threshold after -log10 transformation" = transformation))
